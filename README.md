Basic script using Axios that calls an API and get some weather info from <a href="https://www.weatherapi.com/">Weather API</a>

## Requirements

This script only uses Axios,

## How to run

You can:

`npm start`

## Secret.json

Locally, I use a Secret.json file to keep my keys... looks something like:

```
{
"apiKey":"eW91IHRob3VnaHQgaSBsZWFrZWQgbXkga2V5cz8="
}
```
